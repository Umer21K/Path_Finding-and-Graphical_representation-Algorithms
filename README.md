### This project is a comprehensive Python implementation of various pathfinding algorithms and graphical representations of different types of graphs. It includes the following features:

-Pathfinding Algorithms:

1. Augmenting Path
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
3. Prim's Algorithm
4. Graph Representations:

-Complete Graph
1. Bipartite Graph
2. Simple Graph
3. Tripartite Graph

-Graph Realizations:

Havel-Hakimi Algorithm

-Graphical Presentations:

Visual representation of all the implemented graphs and algorithms using graphical tools.

## Algorithms
### Augmenting Path
An implementation of the augmenting path algorithm for finding maximum matching in bipartite graphs.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
An implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

### Prim's Algorithm
An implementation of Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph.

## Graph Representations
Complete Graph
A graph in which there is an edge between every pair of vertices.

### Bipartite Graph
A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.

### Simple Graph
A graph without loops and multiple edges.

### Tripartite Graph
A graph whose vertices can be divided into three disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.

## Havel-Hakimi Algorithm
An implementation of the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to construct a simple graph from a given degree sequence.

## Graphical Presentations
The project includes graphical representations for all the implemented algorithms and graph types. The visualizations are created using libraries such as Matplotlib .
